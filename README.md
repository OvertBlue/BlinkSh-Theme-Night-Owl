# BlinkSh-Theme-Night-Owl
This is the [Night Owl Theme](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) for [BlinkSh for iOS](https://github.com/blinksh). I also used the the [Windows Terminal Night Owl Theme](https://github.com/edurojasr/Windows-Terminal-Theme-Night-Owl) to ensure the colors were where I wanted them.

Installation instructions:
Open "Settings"
Select "Appearance"
Select "Add a new theme"
Type a name for the theme.
Paste the URL for NightOwl.js in the "JS THEME FILE" field and select "Import"
Select "Save"
Close and relaunch BlinkSh
