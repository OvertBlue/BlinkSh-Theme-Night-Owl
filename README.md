# BlinkSh-Theme-Night-Owl
This is the [Night Owl Theme](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) for [BlinkSh for iOS](https://github.com/blinksh). I also used the the [Windows Terminal Night Owl Theme](https://github.com/edurojasr/Windows-Terminal-Theme-Night-Owl) to ensure the colors were consistent.

Installation instructions:
1. Open "Settings"
2. Select "Appearance"
3. Select "Add a new theme"
4. Type a name for the theme.
5. Paste the URL for NightOwl.js in the "JS THEME FILE" field and select "Import"
6. Select "Save"
7. Close and relaunch BlinkSh
